# code-of-conduct ðŸŒˆ
Code of conduct tl;dr:

Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if they do something to harm you, and if you can't resolve an issue, contact the slack owners/admins. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.

## About the Archivists Working with Archival Data Slack
We strive to be an intentionally helpful, professional, positive and respectful community that recognizes and celebrates the important mission of the LAM sector to bring evidence of human achievement to the world. This mission is best met when we uplift the diversity of people, cultures and backgrounds in the LAM sector.

## Goals
We aim to provide an inclusive, anti-oppressive environment where all are treated respectfully regardless of race, nationality, ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, age, ability, belief system, physical appearance, politics, educational attainment or technical fluency.

Respectful behavior includes:
* An open and helpful approach to knowledge building. 
   - Not everyone knows everything, but together we know a lot.
   - Do not assume where a person is starting from -- they may already know a lot about this topic, or they may need help starting from the beginning. Use those reference interview skills to help a person where they are!
* Take the testimony and lived experiences of others seriously.
    - Outcome is more important than intent. Make an effort to understand how your words or deeds affected someone else.

Demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery will not be tolerated.

## Accountability and Privacy
This Slack is most useful when members can speak frankly about the challenges they face and can get help. Because so many technical challenges have political roots, members may choose to speak about their workplaces. However, membership is large, and members should be prudent about what they post. 

All members have the power to invite others and there is no process for approving new members. All members (new and existing) will be subject to this code of conduct once it is ratified.

## Addressing Harm
We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.
If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so.

### Apologize for Mistakes
Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle mistakes, and that you center the experience of the person you have harmed.

### Protocols
If you experience disrespectful behavior and feel in any way unable to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an admin or owner. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just icky in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

If the admins/owners determine that a participant is behaving disrespectfully, we will try our best to act in a way that centers the safety of the person being harmed. If participants feel that they can work through issues on their own, we encourage them to start with that action, but we are happy and willing to participate in a mediation or removal process if appropriate.

As admins/owners, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and quickly, and in a manner that is positive for the community.
